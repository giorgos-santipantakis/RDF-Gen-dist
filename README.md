RDF-Gen (JAR) distribution

Transforming disparate and heterogeneous data sources that provide large volumes of data in high velocity into a common form, allows integrated and enriched views on data and thus, provides further opportunities to advance the effectiveness and accuracy of data analysis and prediction tasks. RDF-Gen transforms data provided by archival and streaming data sources in various formats, into RDF triples, according to a set of ontological specifications. RDF-Gen introduces a generic mechanism which supports the transformation of data efficiently even in cases where the velocity of data presents high peaks.

Data transformation configuration (data source, mappings to template's variables, etc) are provided in an RDF configuration file.
